2. **Use Technical Terms**: Include relevant technical keywords
3. **Specify Time Period**: Mention if you want recent patents (default: last 3 years)
4. **Include Applications**: Mention specific use cases

### Example Good Queries
‚úÖ **Good**: "Machine learning algorithms for early cancer detection in medical imaging"
‚úÖ **Good**: "Blockchain technology for supply chain transparency in food industry"
‚úÖ **Good**: "5G network optimization for autonomous vehicle communication"

‚ùå **Avoid**: "AI" (too broad)
‚ùå **Avoid**: "Technology" (too vague)
‚ùå **Avoid**: "Everything about computers" (too general)

### Interpreting Results
1. **Look for Patterns**: Identify recurring themes across patents
2. **Check Assignees**: Note which companies are most active
3. **Review Classifications**: Understand the patent categories
4. **Analyze Trends**: See how the technology is evolving

## üîÑ Advanced Features

### Memory and Learning

### Rate Limiting
To ensure fair usage:
- **5 research requests** per 5 minutes per user
- **20 patent searches** per minute per user
- **10 analysis requests** per 5 minutes per user

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Processing your research request..." Takes Too Long
- **Wait**: Research typically takes 2-5 minutes
- **Check Internet**: Ensure stable internet connection
- **Try Again**: If it fails, try the same query again

#### "Invalid research topic" Error
- **Check Length**: Ensure your query is 3-500 characters
- **Be Specific**: Make your query more specific
- **Use Keywords**: Include relevant technical terms

#### "Error during processing" Message
- **Check Connection**: Ensure stable internet connection
- **Try Later**: System might be temporarily busy
- **Contact Support**: If problem persists

#### Rate Limit Exceeded
- **Wait**: Wait a few minutes before trying again
- **Check Limits**: Review the rate limiting section above
- **Plan Queries**: Space out your research requests

### Getting Help
If you encounter issues:
1. **Check this guide** for common solutions
2. **Review error messages** for specific information
3. **Contact your administrator** for technical support
4. **Check system status** if available
